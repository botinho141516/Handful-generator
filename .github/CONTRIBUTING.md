## How Can I contribute??? 🤔

### Reporting Bugs or bad templates

In the issues section on github you can submit an issue for a bug fix, and template upgrade or a new template. 

#### Before submiting an Issue

1. Check if there is a similar issue or request
2. Check if this is a universal request for templates or something more espefic for you, the ideia is a tool for every one 🤗
3. Be clear and descriptive in the Title and in the body of the issue request
4. Try to include screenshots and gifs for better understanding of the problem

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a 
   build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment 
   variables, exposed ports, useful file locations and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this
   Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).

   do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.

## Code of Conduct

As a tool for helping developers kickstart projects easier and in a frendily enviroment, the same is expected for issues debates and feature requests.

Questions and new ideas are always welcome, maybe a template is not good for this repo but we can create new branches and forks with especific implementations 😉
