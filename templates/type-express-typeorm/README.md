## Database

This projects uses the [TypeORM](https://typeorm.io/#/) Database for operations with persistant models


## Start Using it ðŸ™Œ

### Install All dependencies

`npm i`

Make sure you have eslint configure right on your VSCode

### Configure the database

In the ormconfig.json you can confingure your connections

### Sync your models

To get your database up and running you can run `npm run db:sync` then it will load all the tables to your database

### Run migrations

To populate your database you can run `npm run db:migrate` then it will load all your migrations into the database

### Run dev mode

To run it in dev mode with Nodemon - already configured. Just run `npm run dev` and it will boot up a development server watching for files in the src/ directory

## Auth and Token

This template has a express limit api so for user routes it limits the request for a pre determined time, if the user reaches it, it gets a `429` and the token gets revoked in the tokens table.



For the auth route, it has a throttle down logic that increases the response time in 100ms after the reqs limit

`**CONSIDER USING MONGO OR REDIS DISTRIBUTED FOR TOKEN CONTROL AND CRONJON TO CLEAN THE DATABASE FOR TOKENS THAT ARE EXPIRED ( USE ENV FOR SETTING THE TIME FOR EXPIRE AND CONJOB TO CLEANUP THE DB)**`
